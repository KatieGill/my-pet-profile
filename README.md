# MY PET PROFILE
My Pet Profile is an app for pet owners to keep all of their pets' information in once place. A user can create a profile for each pet and input diet and medication information. A user can also view contact information for veterinary hospitals, add selected hospitals to a favorites list, and create notes for each hospital. 

This React app was created as a learning project for Developes Web Academy. This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge with React, React Router, and TypeScript. The app initially utilized json-server so I could implement API requests, but it now has it's own dedicated backend.
